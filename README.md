# Juniors Spring Intensive Deliverable Proposal

Dates 3/16-3/25

**My Name:** 
Subal Pant

**Project Name:** 
CoronaStats

**Is your project New or Old?**
New

**Is your project Solo or Team?**
Solo

## Description

**Write a paragraph summary of the current status of your project, what you hope to achieve during the intensive, how and why**
The project is a new project that I am starting. I wish to inform people about COVID-19 by displaying data using datasets that John Hopkins has provided to the public.
They have a portal available for displaying similar information but I wish for mine to be more lightweight and not have to access a backend. During the intensive, I want
to build a front-enb web application that processes datasets to display statistics and trends about COVID-19. I believe this is important during this time because
much of the public doesn't know that much about the disease and how much of an affect it is having on our country.

## Challenges I Anticipate

**List out the challenges you anticipate for completing this project**
-processing the data as the quantity of data is huge
-making all the data display neatly

## Skateboard

**ONE SINGLE aspect of product. Consider: build backend for SPD 1.2 front end, CRUD one resource, use API or library, authentication etc.**
Build simple front-end for web application

## Bike
**ONE additional features that get you closer to your idealized product. Examples: CRUD 2nd resource, add comments, API use, authentication, library use**
Process data from John Hopkins GitHub and generate graphs and numbers using the data (make it display to command line at least)

## Car
**ONE additional feature**
Incorporate the processed data into the front-end and publish it to Heroku

## Personal Achievement Goals:

**Each teammate must achieve 2 of 3 of their self-set personal achievement goals. If you're not on a team, delete the other teammate sections as needed.**

### Goals

1. Practice my skills learned in DS 1.1 to process CSV data using Pandas
2. Practice my skills from BEW 1.1 to build a front-end that looks neat
3. Reuse code I have written in the past to efficiently complete my project


## Wireframes
